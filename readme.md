# TARS Quote

A miniature TARS with an OLED display that shows text that is sent to it via Firebase. 
A close friend of mine is a huge Interstellar fan, so I'm making this for her. 

### Features
- Show quote
	- From multiple people
	- Tracked with Firebase? I've used it before with ESP32 so should be straightforward
	- *Requires: ESP32, 0.96" OLED*
- Scroll if longer quotes
	- *Requires: EC11 rotary encoder (with button because why not)*
