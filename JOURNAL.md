## 10/6/2025 - Brainstorm + Drawing  

##### TARS Quote
A heartfelt communication device based on the robot TARS from Interstellar![Screenshot 2025-10-05 at 10.30.19 PM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Njc2LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--ef02b4fb3f413bc63f60397b2cae0c28c4918e08/Screenshot%202025-10-05%20at%2010.30.19%E2%80%AFPM.png)


This has been a vague idea brewing for a while, so first I brainstormed: 
### Features
- Show quote
	- From multiple people
	- Tracked with Firebase? I've used it before with ESP32 so should be straightforward
	- *Requires: ESP32, 0.96" OLED*
- Scroll if longer quotes
	- *Requires: EC11 rotary encoder (with button because why not)*
- Change position or walk
	- needs servos

###### Cool features that I might want to add (based on GPTARS):
- moving each of the four segments individually
- speaker so it can talk
- or microphone and speaker combo to make it walkie-talkie (but over WiFi)
- lights because LEDs make everything cooler

###### Other software features
- Auto dim at night
- Display on/off switch (will reset in the morning)
- LED patterns

I don't want to make it too complicated (yet) so that's all the features for now. 
Added features to readme. 

Made rough CAD drawings (2D) of the top face in Fusion, with dimensions. It occurs to me that if I want this thing to walk or at least have motors in the joints that actually do something, then I'll need some translational motion at least on the outer legs. That kind of assembly will be added because I want it to be able to walk  

## 10/7/2025 - CAD  

I normally start with the PCB but for this project I think it makes more sense for me to fit the PCB to the case (TARS not CASE) which means that I have to actually make the PCB. 

###### CAD
The drawing I started with was the entire top face but I actually need to separate it... so I have to split sketch or something. 

I started with the central piece, but then realized that the OLED I planned to use (0.95" SSD1331) is too big for what I'd drawn before. There's a really nice model of the robots here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5156908 
So I used these dimensions to start (22x176x22mm). 
For the TARS lettering I found the font they used in the movie (Trade Gothic LT Std) and installed that. 

Here's the top face (center only)

Took me an hour to discover circular pattern + combine intersect for the side piece. Thank goodness I can rectangular pattern it to make the second one.

Finished CAD for now. Will add arm servos for the side pieces later, and will fill in the rest of the central portion once a PCB and other electronics have been added.
