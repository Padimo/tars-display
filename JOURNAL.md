## 10/6/2025 - Brainstorm + Drawing  

##### TARS Quote
A heartfelt communication device based on the robot TARS from Interstellar![Screenshot 2025-10-05 at 10.30.19â€¯PM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Njc2LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--ef02b4fb3f413bc63f60397b2cae0c28c4918e08/Screenshot%202025-10-05%20at%2010.30.19%E2%80%AFPM.png)


This has been a vague idea brewing for a while, so first I brainstormed: 
### Features
- Show quote
	- From multiple people
	- Tracked with Firebase? I've used it before with ESP32 so should be straightforward
	- *Requires: ESP32, 0.96" OLED*
- Scroll if longer quotes
	- *Requires: EC11 rotary encoder (with button because why not)*
- Change position or walk
	- needs servos

###### Cool features that I might want to add (based on GPTARS):
- moving each of the four segments individually
- speaker so it can talk
- or microphone and speaker combo to make it walkie-talkie (but over WiFi)
- lights because LEDs make everything cooler

###### Other software features
- Auto dim at night
- Display on/off switch (will reset in the morning)
- LED patterns

I don't want to make it too complicated (yet) so that's all the features for now. 
Added features to readme. 

Made rough CAD drawings (2D) of the top face in Fusion, with dimensions. It occurs to me that if I want this thing to walk or at least have motors in the joints that actually do something, then I'll need some translational motion at least on the outer legs. That kind of assembly will be added because I want it to be able to walk
